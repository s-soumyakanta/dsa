Traversal is one of the fundamental operations in data structures, involving visiting each element systematically. In the context of arrays, traversal means accessing each eleme nt from the beginning to the end of the array. This operation is crucial for various tasks such as searching, updating, and processing data.

Space complexity - 10 byte space - low space taking code in system is called space complexity

Time Complexity - It depends upon sytem and no of line
